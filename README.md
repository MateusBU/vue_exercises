## Project Overview

This project implements a **user registration system** using [**Vue.js**](https://vuejs.org/), a progressive JavaScript framework for building interactive user interfaces. The project includes frontend components for user interaction and integrates with a Firebase database for data storage.

## What is Vue.js?

Vue.js is a lightweight, flexible JavaScript framework designed for building interactive user interfaces with ease. Key features include:

- ✅ **Component-based architecture:** Build modular and reusable UI components.
- ✅ **Declarative rendering:** Simplified binding between data and UI.
- ✅ **Vue Router:** Manage navigation and URLs in single-page applications.
- ✅ **Pinia or Vuex:** State management for complex applications.
- ✅ **Firebase integration:** Manage backend with cloud database and authentication.
- ✅ **Lightweight and high-performance.**

## Folder Structure & Routing

Vue uses a **component-based architecture** combined with **Vue Router** for navigation. Below is an example of the project structure.

### 📂 Example Folder Structure

src/
├── assets/ → Static assets (images, styles)
├── components/ → Vue components
│ └── UserForm.vue → User registration form
├── router/ → Vue Router configuration
│ └── index.js
├── views/ → Route/page components
│ ├── HomeView.vue → /
│ └── AboutView.vue → /about
├── App.vue → Root component
├── main.js → Application entry point
├── firebase.js → Firebase configuration


### 🌐 Routing Example

| File/Folder Path      | URL      |
| :-------------------- | :------- |
| `views/HomeView.vue`  | `/`      |
| `views/AboutView.vue` | `/about` |

Routing is handled by Vue Router, linking URLs to components in `views/`.
